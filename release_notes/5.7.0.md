# Jasmine 5.7.0 Release Notes

This release updates the jasmine-core dependency to 5.7.0. See the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.7.0.md)
for more information.

## New features and bug fixes

* Added `--filter-path=` option to do exact (non-regex) prefix filtering
* Updated help text to clarify that `--filter=` takes a regex
* Added `enumerate` subcommand to list suites and specs

## Internal improvements

* Removed mostly-unmaintained dev dependency 'temp'
* Updated to eslint 9
* Updated dev dependency shelljs

## Supported environments

This version has been tested on Node 18*, 20, and 22.

\* Environments that are past end of life are supported on a best-effort basis.
They may be dropped in a future minor release of Jasmine if continued support
becomes impractical.
