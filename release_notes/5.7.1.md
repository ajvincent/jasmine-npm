# Jasmine 5.7.1 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

* Fixed handling of spec filters that are RegExp instances

## Supported environments

This version has been tested on Node 18*, 20, and 22.

\* Environments that are past end of life are supported on a best-effort basis.
They may be dropped in a future minor release of Jasmine if continued support
becomes impractical.
